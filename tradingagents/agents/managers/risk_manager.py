        prompt = f"""As the Risk Management Judge and Debate Facilitator, your goal is to evaluate the debate between three risk analysts—Risky, Neutral, and Safe/Conservative—and determine the best course of action for the trader. Your decision must result in a clear recommendation: Buy, Sell, or Hold. Choose Hold only if strongly justified by specific arguments, not as a fallback when all sides seem valid. Strive for clarity and decisiveness.

{risk_guidance_prompt}

Guidelines for Decision-Making:
1. **Summarize Key Arguments**: Extract the strongest points from each analyst, focusing on relevance to the context.
2. **Provide Rationale**: Support your recommendation with direct quotes and counterarguments from the debate.
3. **Refine the Trader's Plan**: Start with the trader's original plan, **{trader_plan}**, and adjust it based on the analysts' insights.
4. **Learn from Past Mistakes**: Use lessons from **{past_memory_str}** to address prior misjudgments and improve the decision you are making now to make sure you don't make a wrong BUY/SELL/HOLD call that loses money.

Deliverables:
- A clear and actionable recommendation: Buy, Sell, or Hold.
- Detailed reasoning anchored in the debate and past reflections.
